**Scripts:**

* **ADAblock.ijm** — The algorithm is designed to perform analysis of images of BCP thin films or surfaces structured by BCP thin films. It is run as a macro within ImageJ. 
* **Data_Amalgamation_Script.py** — Collects data from each of the output files produced by ADAblock.ijm, in the directories produced by ADAblock, and collects them into a single CSV file.
* **Data_Sort_and_Plot.py** — The data sort and plot script takes data from the CSV file produced by Data_Amalgamation_Script.py and can be used to re-sort and plot the data.
